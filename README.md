LangChain Question Answering System
This project is a Question Answering System built using LangChain, FastAPI (backend), and Streamlit (frontend). It allows users to ask questions and get answers based on a provided context or dataset.

Features
Backend: FastAPI server with LangChain integration for question answering.

Frontend: Streamlit app for user interaction.

Customizable: Add your own dataset or modify the LangChain pipeline.

Docker Support: Easily deploy the app using Docker.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.9 or higher

Pip (Python package manager)

Git

Docker (optional, for containerization)

Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-app.git
cd langchain-app
2. Set Up the Backend
Navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy
cd backend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Add your OpenAI API key:

Replace "your-openai-api-key" in backend/main.py with your actual OpenAI API key.

Add your dataset:

Place your text data in a file named data.txt in the backend folder.

Run the backend server:

bash
Copy
uvicorn main:app --reload
The backend will be available at http://localhost:8000.

3. Set Up the Frontend
Navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy
cd ../frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy
streamlit run app.py
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:8501.

Docker Setup 
If you prefer to run the app using Docker:

Build the Docker images:

bash
Copy
docker build -t langchain-backend -f Dockerfile .
docker build -t langchain-frontend -f Dockerfile .
Run the backend container:

bash
Copy
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 langchain-backend
Run the frontend container:

bash
Copy
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 langchain-frontend
Access the app:

Backend: http://localhost:8000

Frontend: http://localhost:8501

How It Works
The user enters a question in the Streamlit frontend.

The frontend sends the question to the FastAPI backend.

The backend uses LangChain and OpenAI to generate an answer based on the provided dataset.

The answer is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

Customization
Dataset: Replace data.txt with your own dataset.

LangChain Pipeline: Modify the RetrievalQA chain in backend/main.py to use different models or configurations.

API Endpoints: Add more endpoints to the FastAPI backend for additional functionality.
