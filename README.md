# **LangChain Question Answering System**
 
*A robust and scalable Question Answering System built with **LangChain**, **FastAPI**, and **Streamlit**.*

---

## **Overview**

This project is a **production-ready Question Answering System** that leverages the power of **LangChain** and **OpenAI's GPT models** to provide accurate and context-aware answers to user queries. The system is designed with a **FastAPI backend** for seamless API integration and a **Streamlit frontend** for an intuitive user experience. It also supports **Docker** for easy deployment and scalability.

---

## **Key Features**

- **🔍 Context-Aware Answers**: Utilizes LangChain's RetrievalQA pipeline to provide accurate answers based on a provided dataset.
- **🚀 FastAPI Backend**: A high-performance backend with API key authentication, rate limiting, and Swagger documentation.
- **🎨 Streamlit Frontend**: A user-friendly interface with file upload support, interactive settings, and a chat-like interface.
- **🐳 Docker Support**: Containerized for easy deployment and scalability.
- **📂 Customizable Dataset**: Add your own dataset (e.g., text files, PDFs) to tailor the system to your needs.
- **🔒 Secure**: API key authentication and rate limiting to prevent abuse.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **LangChain**: For natural language processing and question answering.
- **OpenAI GPT**: For generating accurate and context-aware responses.
- **FastAPI**: For building a high-performance backend API.
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive and user-friendly frontend.
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment.
- **Docker Compose**: For managing multi-container setups.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.9 or higher**
- **Pip** (Python package manager)
- **Git**
- **Docker** (optional, for containerization)

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-app.git
cd langchain-app
```

### **2. Set Up the Backend**

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add your OpenAI API key:
   - Replace `"your-openai-api-key"` in `backend/main.py` with your actual OpenAI API key.

4. Add your dataset:
   - Place your text data in a file named `data.txt` in the `backend` folder.

5. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   *The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.*

---

### **3. Set Up the Frontend**

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   *The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8501`.*

---

## **Docker Deployment**

To deploy the application using Docker:

1. Build and run the containers using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Access the app:
   - **Backend**: `http://localhost:8000`
   - **Frontend**: `http://localhost:8501`

---

## **How It Works**

1. The user enters a question in the Streamlit frontend.
2. The frontend sends the question to the FastAPI backend via an API request.
3. The backend uses **LangChain** and **OpenAI GPT** to process the question and generate an answer based on the provided dataset.
4. The answer is sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

---

## **Customization**

- **Dataset**: Replace `data.txt` with your own dataset (e.g., text files, PDFs, or JSON).
- **LangChain Pipeline**: Modify the `RetrievalQA` chain in `backend/main.py` to use different models or configurations.
- **API Endpoints**: Add more endpoints to the FastAPI backend for additional functionality (e.g., document upload, multiple datasets).

## **Contributing**

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`).
5. Open a pull request.
